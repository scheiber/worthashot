## Technical Details

- This project was created using a React-based front-end, an Express-based back-end, and a PostgreSQL database.
- The front-end is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the back-end is hosted on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).
- Establishment data is dynamically fetched using the [Yelp Fusion API](https://fusion.yelp.com/), and drink data is stored in [our back-end database](https://worthashot.fly.dev/alcohols).
- This project went from conception to completion in five weeks and was created while fully remote through the [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/) fellowship.

## Local Setup

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Scheiber/worthashot.git
```

It is recommended to use two separate terminal instances so that the front-end and back-end can run concurrently.

### Front-end Setup

Prerequisites are Git and Node.js.

First, navigate to the front-end directory.

```bash
cd worthashot/front-end
```

Next, create a .env file to allow the front-end to access the back-end locally.

```bash
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3003\nREACT_APP_YELP_API_URL=http://localhost:3003/bars" >> .env
```

Next, locally install the required node modules.

```bash
npm i
```

Finally, start the server.

```bash
npm start
```

### Back-end Setup

Prerequisites are Git, Node.js, Postgres, and a [Yelp Fusion API key](https://fusion.yelp.com/).

First, navigate to the back-end directory.

```bash
cd worthashot/back-end
```

Next, create a .env file to access the database locally, inserting your Yelp Fusion API key into the command where indicated.

```bash
echo "PORT=3003\nPG_HOST=localhost\nPG_PORT=5432\nPG_DATABASE=worth_a_shot\nBEARER_TOKEN=[Yelp Fusion API Key goes here]" >> .env
```

Next, locally install the required node modules.

```bash
npm i && npm i -g nodemon
```

Next, initialize and seed the database.

```bash
npm run db
```

Finally, start the server.

```bash
nodemon server.js
```
